    "Welcome to my portfolio! I am deeply passionate about computer science, with a particular interest in web development. Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern as a React Developer at Celebal Technologies, where I honed my skills in building interactive and dynamic web applications. Currently, I am excited to share that I have been placed at Accenture and will begin my professional journey there in July 2025. With a strong foundation in development and a keen interest in problem-solving, I am always eager to explore new technologies and innovate through code.",
    "Beyond tech, I have a deep love for Indian movies and music, which inspires my creativity. I'm also a huge fan of Korean culture, from K-pop to K-dramas, which fuel my passion for dance and singing. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, whipping up delicious dishes, and I love exploring new places whenever I get the chance to travel. Through this blend of passions, I strive to bring a balance of technical expertise and cultural creativity to all aspects of my life."
